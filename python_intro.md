# Python:
Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages in the world. It's known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it an excellent choice for students who are new to coding. Python is versatile and widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and, importantly, in programming microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Variables
In Python, a variable is a symbolic name or label that represents a value stored in the computer's memory. It's like a container or a storage location that can hold different types of data, such as numbers, text, lists, and more. Variables are a fundamental concept in programming and are used to store and manage data in your programs.

Here's how you create a variable and assign a string(word) value to it:
```python
# the variable is my_name, the value of my_name is Megan
my_name = "Megan"
print(my_name)
```

And here's how you create a variable and assign an integer(number) value to it:
```python
# the variable is my_name, the value of my_name is Megan
my_age = 104
print(my_age)
```
